Flutter is a mobile app SDK (software development kit) for building high-performance, high-fidelity apps for iOS and Android.

With powerful graphics and animation libraries, the Flutter framework makes it easy to build user interfaces that react smoothly in response to touch.

Flutter is built on the Dart programming language and provides a fast development workflow with hot reloading, so you can quickly iterate on your code.
