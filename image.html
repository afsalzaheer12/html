    <h3> front end</h3>

    </p>
    The layer above the back end is the front end and it includes all software or hardware that is part of a user interface. Human or digital users interact directly with various aspects of the front end of a program, including user-entered data, buttons, programs, websites  <br>and other features.
    <p>

        <h3>back end</h3>ack-end developers are the experts who build and maintain the mechanisms that process data and perform actions on websites. Unlike front-end developers, who control everything you can see on a website, back-end developers are involved in data storage, security, and other server-side functions that you cannot see.

        Since the late 80s and 90s, the internet has transformed the way humans access information, and web development has continued to evolve. Its central importance to our digital world means web developers are in high demand. Fortunately, anyone can learn the technical skills needed to be front-end, <br> back-end, or full-stack (both front- and back-end) developers.
