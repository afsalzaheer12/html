<div>
    <p id="demo"> 
    Onam ( IPA: [oːɳɐm]) is an annual Indian harvest festival celebrated predominantly by the Hindus of Kerala.[4][5] A major annual event for Keralites, it is the official festival of the state[4][6] and includes a spectrum of cultural events.[7][8][4][9]

Onam commemorates King Mahabali and Vamana.[ <br>10][11] According to Hindu legends, Onam is celebrated in Kerala in remembrance of the good governance under the rule of daitya king Mahabali, a mythical king. The legend holds that jealous of Mahabali's popularity and his power, the devas conspired to end his reign. They sent Vamana to earth in the form of a dwarf Brahmin who trampled Mahabali to patala (underworld). Vamana asked Mahabali for three feet of land as his wish from the generous Mahabali. After measuring the entirety of universe, leaving nowhere to place his third foot, Mahabali offered his own head to place his third feet, making the wish complete. However, witnessing Mahabali’s generosity, Vamana granted the king's sole wish to visit his land and subjects once every year. <br> This homecoming of Mahabali is celebrated as Onam in Kerala every year[12][11]
